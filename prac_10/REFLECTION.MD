# Reflection


2 / 2

Regarding estimations, early on in the process, my estimates tended to be 
overly optimistic. I anticipated tasks, especially program completions, to 
require more time than they actually did. Nevertheless, over time, as my proficiency grew and I became more acquainted with the range of resources at my disposal, my precision in estimating notably enhanced.


Conducting code reviews enabled me to grasp that the errors I committed were frequently shared by my colleagues as well. 
Receiving feedback from peers allowed me to recognise aspects of my code that I had overlooked, some of which turned out to be more prevalent than I had initially thought.

Personally, in regard to practical tasks I think components that relate directly to the assignment material, should be 
developed further than what currently was provided.
